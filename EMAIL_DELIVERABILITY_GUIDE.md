# 🚨 Fix Email Going to Spam - Quick Solutions

## Immediate Actions (Can be done in 30 minutes)

### Option 1: Use Resend's Shared Domain (Quick Fix)
**Change your sender email to**: `onboarding@resend.dev`

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Authentication → SMTP Settings
2. Change **Sender Email** from `noreply@yourdomain.com` to `onboarding@resend.dev`
3. Change **Sender Name** to `Beautify App` (avoid "Support" or "No-Reply")
4. Save changes

**Pros**: Works immediately, no domain setup needed
**Cons**: Lower deliverability, shared reputation

### Option 2: Get a Quick Domain (Recommended)

#### Free/Cheap Domain Options:
1. **Freenom** (Free): Get a `.tk`, `.ml`, `.ga` domain for free
2. **Namecheap** ($8-12/year): Professional `.com` domain
3. **Cloudflare** ($8-10/year): Domain + free DNS management

#### Quick Setup with Namecheap:
1. Go to [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com)
2. Search for `beautify-ai.com` or similar
3. Purchase domain (~$10)
4. Use Namecheap's DNS or transfer to Cloudflare (free)

### Option 3: Professional Email Subject Lines

Change your email subjects to avoid spam triggers:

**Instead of**: ❌ "Verify Your Email"
**Use**: ✅ "Welcome to Beautify - Confirm Your Account"

**Instead of**: ❌ "Reset Password"  
**Use**: ✅ "Beautify Account Security - Password Reset"

3. Test with different devices and email clients

## Monitor Email Performance

### In Resend Dashboard:
