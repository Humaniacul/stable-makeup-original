# 🚀 Professional Email Templates - Implementation Guide

## ✨ What's Changed

Your old email templates were basic and could trigger spam filters. The new templates are:

- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern layout with proper branding

- **Anti-Spam Optimized**: Proper structure, content ratio, and trust signals
- **Brand Consistent**: Matches your Beautify app design and colors
- **Security-Focused**: Clear explanations and trust indicators

## 📋 Quick Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Supabase Email Templates

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Navigate to:** Authentication → Email Templates
3. **Update each template** with the new code from `RESEND_INTEGRATION_SETUP.md`

### Step 2: Update Subject Lines

Use these professional subject lines in Supabase:

**For Signup Verification:**
```

```

**For Password Reset:**
```
Secure your Beautify account - Password reset requested
```

**For Email Change:**

```

### Step 3: Update Sender Settings

In Supabase SMTP Settings:
- **Sender Name:** `Beautify Team` (not "noreply" or "support")
- **Sender Email:** `hello@beautify-app.com` (use your verified domain)

### Step 4: Replace Email Placeholders

In the templates, replace these placeholders with your actual information:
- `support@beautify-app.com` → Your actual support email
